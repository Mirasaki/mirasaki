        <!-- About my developer journey -->
        <h2>My developer journey this far</h2>
        <p>
          I started my self-taught development journey about 2 years ago, back
          in 2020. Initially, I just wanted to make Discord bots that me and my
          friends were interested in. We were looking for specific functionality
          that wasn't publicly available at the time and so I thought to myself
          <q>Why not just make it myself?</q>
          <br />
        </p>
        <!-- <div class="dotted-hr"></div> -->
        <p>
          And so I started my journey. I kicked things off with
          <strong>The Odin Project's</strong> <q>Foundations course</q> but gave
          up and stopped following the course about 2 weeks in. I just didn't
          enjoy it. I knew I was supposed to be learning the foundations and
          basics of development, no matter what specific area. But I just wanted
          to make Discord bots. So I stopped the course, and instead went to
          YouTube and looked for some JavaScript/Node videos on how to create
          those Discord bots that I wanted to make so badly.
        </p>
        <!-- <div class="dotted-hr"></div> -->
        <p>
          I found some tutorials by a YouTube channel called
          <q>Worn Off Keys</q> and quickly fell in love with creating Discord
          bots that I could show off to my friends. Although I was proud of what
          I was creating, I was struggling with the core concept of
          Node/JavaScript and how to use it. I had to google every simple task
          and operation. I learned how to effectively use search engines to get
          the answer I was looking for, but I didn't properly understand the
          answers I was given. I did realize this. I was struggling like this
          for about six months, the first half-year of my developer journey. I
          was just incredibly proud of the small things I did know how to do and
          wanted to build more, that's why I kept going like this, for way
          longer than I should have.
        </p>
        <!-- <div class="dotted-hr"></div> -->
        <p>
          But eventually, I did realize something had to change in order for me
          to be efficient in any way, shape or form. I started by going to the
          MDN JavaScript documentation and taking courses on Udemy, learning all
          the basics from working with strings, data, mapping, objects, and
          loops - to understanding scopes, all the different available data
          structures, working with APIs, memory management, event-loop based
          concurrency, synchronous and asynchronous JS and the differences
          between them.
        </p>
        <!-- <div class="dotted-hr"></div> -->
        <p>
          So that's what I've been doing this far - almost 2 years in - working
          with NodeJS (non-browser JavaScript) and API's. Pretty much doing what
          I wanted to do. This all started out of interest, a hobby. And I
          thoroughly enjoyed every single day of it
          <em
            >except maybe for that first half year of not having the slightest
            clue as to what I was doing</em
          >.
        </p>
        <!-- <div class="dotted-hr"></div> -->
        <p>
          And now here we are, May 2022, and I just started a web development
          <q>boot-camp</q> on Udemy. I've made a couple of mediocre,
          unimpressive sites this far, and I am eager to learn more and some
          day, <em>hopefully</em>, realizing my dream of becoming a full-stack
          developer, as there is nothing I'd rather do.
